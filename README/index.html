<h2>Development:</h2>
<p>We use eleventy to reduce the usage of boilerplate code. Since eleventy is built ontop of nodejs you will need to install that on your platform. Run <code>npm install</code> in the cloned directory to install eleventy. Once eleventy is installed, you can run <code>eleventy --serve</code> and it will run a web server which will live update when you edit a file.</p>
<h2>Adding boards:</h2>
<p>If you have a board already ported to SonixQMK, make a new directory with the manufacturers name if there is not one already (ex: womier, redragon). In that folder make another one with the model number (ex: k66, k552), you can just copy another boards docs and edit it from there. We require documentation for Windows, Mac and Linux. They are all pretty similar though.</p>
